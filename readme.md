## codeml_FE

This is a repository for a forked version of codeml that implements an expanded set of fixed-effect codon models.  The models allow simultaneous variation of multiple evolutionary process among sites (kappas, pis, w, branch lengths). Treating the variation as a fixed-effect permits explicit hypothesis testing according to *a priori* biological information (*e.g.,* known structural features of a protein).

The paper describing the method is:
